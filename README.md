Text Classification

**Task**: To build a model to classify the scientific papers into various categories like statistics, computer science, physics etc. on the basis of their abstracts.

This repository contains standard implementation of three popular Machine Learning Algorithms.
1. Logistic Regression
2. Gaussina NB
3. Linear SVC

The main idea of this project is to experiment whether a collborative decision making approach (**Voting Algorithm**) based on the votes provided by the three standard algorithms can outperform the standard algorithms or not.

**Result**: Feel free to clone the repository and check it yourself. :P
